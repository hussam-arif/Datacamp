# Intro to SQL - Key Notes

- **Databases** store data in tables organized into rows and columns.
- Tables in databases can include data such as:
  - **Patrons**: library card number, name, membership year, fines owed.
  - **Books**: book details.
  - **Checkouts**: records of borrowed books.

- **Relational databases** link data between tables, enabling questions like:
  - "Which books did James check out in 2022?"
  - "Which books are checked out most often?"

- **Advantages of databases** include:
  - Greater power and storage capacity than spreadsheets.
  - Enhanced security with encryption.
  - Ability for multiple users to query data simultaneously.

- **SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a powerful tool for:
  - Creating databases.
  - Querying data.
  - Updating data while leaving the original information unchanged.
