# Intro to SQL - Key Notes

1. **Databases** store data in tables (rows and columns).
2. Tables in databases can include data like:
   - **Patrons**: library card number, name, membership year, fines owed.
   - **Books**: book information.
   - **Checkouts**: records of borrowed books.
3. **Relational databases** link data between tables, enabling questions like:
   - "Which books did James check out in 2022?"
   - "Which books are checked out most often?"
4. **Advantages of databases**:
   - More powerful than spreadsheets.
   - Can store more data securely.
   - Allow multiple users to query data simultaneously.
5. **SQL (Structured Query Language)**:
   - Used to create, query, and update databases.
   - Accesses and presents data without changing it.
